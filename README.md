# Analogy

A tool to help you [capture your thoughts](https://www.notion.so/Analogy-1dbcb30dcbe8469f932dfc552c21dc19) in the way your brain processes them.

### Aspirations

- Capture notes and link them together with meaningful relations.
- Build a knowledge base that works like your brain (both in terms of structure, querying, and spontaneous creativity),
- Improve memory not just of single-concept spaces, but entire contextual subgraphs.
- Add organically to your knowledge base by integrating other people's subgraphs into yours.
- "Think, then link" – the 'power features' get out of your way, but encourage their own use.
- "Know what you don't know" - identify both known unknowns (loosely-linked nodes) and unknown unknowns (subgraphs lacking clustering or heirarchy).
- Discover + (serious) play with your own mind and memory.
